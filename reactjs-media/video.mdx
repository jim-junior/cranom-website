## Video Player

The react video player is a component for native video players but it is optimized to look the same in all browsers and have a great UI and is highly customized.
It consumes both the native browser event DOM api and the react event API making it fast.

## Usage

To use the react video player component you haveto import it r=from the `reactjs-media` module as `ReactVideo`

**Example**

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { ReactVideo } from "reactjs-media";

const MyVideo = () => {
	return (
		<>
			<ReactVideo
				src="/video.mp4"
				poster="/poster.png"
				//you can pass in other props
			/>
		</>
	);
};
```

Your can also import the video player from another file in the package.

```jsx
import { ReactVideo } from "reactjs-media/video";
```

## customization

To custiomize the main theme color of the video player you have to pass in a prop named `primaryColor`

```jsx
import { ReactVideo } from "reactjs-media";

export const Video = () => (
	<div>
		<ReactVideo
			src="/Learn useCallback In 8 Minutes.mp4"
			poster="/uganda-smoke-flag-isolated-black-background-199119742.jpg"
			primaryColor="red"
		/>
	</div>
);
```

---

```jsx live
function Clock(props) {
	const [date, setDate] = useState(new Date());
	useEffect(() => {
		var timerID = setInterval(() => tick(), 1000);

		return function cleanup() {
			clearInterval(timerID);
		};
	});

	function tick() {
		setDate(new Date());
	}

	return (
		<div>
			<h2>It is {date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
		</div>
	);
}
```

## Component Props

The package also has additional pros that your can pass throug is so that you can carry out some logic. A feww important ones will be listed here you can find the full list in the [API section](videoprop.mdx)

### `src`

-   The `src` prop is a string and it represents the source of the video being played. You should not that it is also a **required** prop so if your dont pass it in the component will throw an **error**.

**Example**

```jsx {4}
const Video = () => {
	return <div>
        <ReactVideo
        src="/Learn useCallback In 8 Minutes.mp4"
        poster="/uganda-smoke-flag-isolated-black-background-199119742.jpg"
    />
    <div>;
};
```

### `poster`

-   The `poster` prop is a string and it represents the poster of the video being played.

**Example**

```jsx {5}
const Video = () => {
	return <div>
        <ReactVideo
        src="/Learn useCallback In 8 Minutes.mp4"
        poster="/ASJDXJ.........XS.....42.jpg"
    />
    <div>;
};
```

### `type`

This represents the type of the video it usally defaults to `video/mp4`. the values expexted is a string.

### `onTimeUpdate`

This props is also passed down in form of a fuction. The function that your pass in will recieve three arguments and these are:

-   #### `event`

This is a native browser event that is usally triggered each time the video time updates. It is the first argument you will receive

-   #### `currentTime`

This is a the current time that the video playback has reached.

-   #### `duration`

This is the full video duration. This is anded in just because we thought it was necessary.

```jsx {10}
const Video = () => {
    function onTimeUpdateProp(event, currentTime, duration) {
        // some logic is place here
    }

	return <div>
        <ReactVideo
        src="/Learn useCallback In 8 Minutes.mp4"
        ....
        onTimeUpdate={onTimeUpdateProp}
    />
    <div>;
};
```
